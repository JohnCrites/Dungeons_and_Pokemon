ABOUT DUNGEONS AND POKEMON
--------------------------

Dungeons and Pokemon will be an adaption of Dungeons and Dragons. I say will be because
it is no where near finished yet and I'm not sure if it will be in the near future. 
What I can tell you is me and a friend are working on it to make it simple and convenient.
The game will be played on the DnD mat-map and dungeons will still be kept by a dungeon
master. However, all stats and battle info will be recorded in files using this program.
The dungeon master will be the one operating the computer and keeping track of trainers'
progress, similar to DnD. The difference is each trainer can have up to 3 pokemon in
their party.

FILE LAYOUTS
------------

The pokemon stats will be as follows;

Health points
Defence points
Attack points
type

I will use accurate stats from the game in the program. If there are any errors, feel
free to contact me.


NOTE: I am currently a CS1 student in college and a computer science major, so there
are many things I do not know. If you have any comments or suggestions, feel free to 
contact me on github. I don't check there often, but I will get back to you asap. If 
there are any bugs you come accross or things that cause the game to crash, please
please please let me know.

Thank you for checking this out and enjoy!
